        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>One of the biggest obstacles for many pregnant Ugandan women is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center, about an hour by foot. Can you imagine trying to walk an hour on foot when you were pregnant and in labor? </p>
        <p>SAFE provides motorcycle ambulances can help this problem, but it is often difficult for mothers to contact them in time. This application provides an intuitive solution to connect mothers and motorcycle ambulance drivers to get them the care they need.</p>
        <a href="/index.html#how-it-works" class="how-it-works">How it Works</a>
        <h2>SAFE</h2>
        <p>SAFE was founded to address the obstacles pregnant mothers face when giving birth. We believe that no woman should die while bringing life into the world, and that no child should die when their life is just beginning. We also believe in the capacity and ingenuity of local people to affect change.</p>
        <p>Together, we partner to improve the "Three Delays" that collectively lead to maternal and child death. Over time, SAFE has developed an innovative, community-based, and evidence-based model targeting the "Three Delays" to ensure that mothers and children in the first 1,000 days of life lead healthy, empowered lives.</p>
        <a href="http://www.safemotherssafebabies.org/" class="learn-more">Learn More</a>
        <h2>Ride for Life</h2>
        <p>The Ride for Life application seeks to reduce the Second Delay of getting to a healthcare facility by enabling mothers access to a network of motorcycle ambulance drivers with an intuitive, modern and scalable solution. Within minutes of going into labor, a mother will know that help is on the way.</p>

                <p>Stephanie received her MPH in Global Health and Physician Assistant degrees from Emory University, and brings an extraordinary amount of knowledge and experience to SAFE, having worked in several countries on different continents on MCH projects. In her own words: "Pregnancy and birth are events that should be celebrated and yet due to a lack of accessible healthcare and established cultural norms that leave families in fear of medicalized births, 800 women die every day due to preventable causes surrounding pregnancy and childbirth. With proper prenatal care and skilled attendance at birth, not only can health outcomes be dramatically improved for women and children, but so can the livelihood of the community." In daytime hours, Stephanie maintains her clinical practice as a Physician Assistant in pediatric HIV in Atlanta, GA, and enjoys spending time with her husband, Ryan, and son, Foster.</p>
